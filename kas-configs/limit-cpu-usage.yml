# Every file needs to contain a header, that provides kas with information
# about the context of this file.
header:
  # The `version` entry in the header describes for which configuration
  # format version this file was created for. It is used by kas to figure
  # out if it is compatible with this file. The version is an integer that
  # is increased on every format change.
  version: 16

# This is unfortunately not a one size fits all stuff. Please read

# If used correctly, it will give you the benefit of having almost no
# overcommitment (hence, build time slightly decreases) and you may be able
# to use your PC for some other stuff in the meantime
